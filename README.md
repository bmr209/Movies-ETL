# Movie Magic

#### I've been asked by Amazing Prime to create an automated pipeline for movie data. The pipeline will take in new data, transform the data into the appropriate format and then load the data into existing tables in a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline will consist of a function that takes in 3 files, Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data.
